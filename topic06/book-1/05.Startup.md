## Startup.

The Cypress framework has already been added to both our lab app - see devdependencies section of `package.json` in either project folder.

### Contact List app.

In a terminal window, go to `twoApps/contactList` and start the Cypress interactive test runner:
~~~
$ npx cypress open
~~~
As this is the first time running the tool in this project, Cypress scaffolds some content, including `cypress.json` (for configuration) and a `cypress` subfolder (for the test code and other artifacts). 

![][cypressinit]

Stop the test runner by hitting cntl/c.

In `contactList/cypress.json` add this entry:
~~~
{
    "baseUrl": "http://localhost:3000/"
}
~~~
This tells Cypress where our app is being hosted.

Optional: In `contactList/cypress/integration` delete the `examples` folder - it contains sample test specs which can be useful when learning the Cypress API. 

### Hacker News app.

In `twoApps/hackerNews` repeat the above steps - we will use it later.
