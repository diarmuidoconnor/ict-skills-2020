This sample should be added to the 'basicReactLab' project of last week's lab 1 exercise. The steps are:

1. Copy 06_state.js to basicReactLab/components/samples folder.
2. In basicReactLab/stories/samples.js add this import at the top:

     import CounterState from '../components/samples/06_state'

and add these stories at the bottom:

    storiesOf('ReactBasics/Samples/06 stateful component', module)
        .add('default', 
           () =>  <CounterState /> 
        )
        .add('normal', 
           () =>  <CounterState jump={3} /> 
        )
        .add('error', 
           () => <CounterState jump={'high'} /> 
        )

3. Start the Storybook server and examine the component in the browser.
