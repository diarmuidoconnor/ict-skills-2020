## Startup.

When the user clicks the 'Comments' link beside a news item the app should navigate to a new view that allow users write comments about that post. The illustration below shows an example of this new view:  
 
![][comment]

The URL for the new view will be parameterized: 

>'http://localhost:3000/posts/:post_id', where :post_id will be the news post's id in the data store.

A comment's properties include author, upvote count, the comment text and an id. A news item's comments will be stored in an array, nested inside the news object, for example:
~~~
{ 
    id: 2,
    title : 'The button that is not.',
    link : 'http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/12/15/button-isnt/',
    username : 'notme',
    comments : [
        {
            id: 1,
            author: 'Joe Bloggs',
            comment: 'I agree with .....',
            upvotes: 5
        },
        {               {
            id: 2,
            author: 'Jane Smith',
            comment: 'On the other hand .....',
            upvotes: 2
        }
    ],
    upvotes : 12
}
~~~
In `hackerNews/src` create the file/folder structure shown below:

![][folders]

Given the similarities between this page and the main page (web form, upvoting), their is not a need to step through its development in such small steps.
